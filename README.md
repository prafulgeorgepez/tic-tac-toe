# tic-tac-toe
This repository contains a Tic-Tac-Toe game project developed as a study exercise to explore key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), algorithmic thinking, and user interface (UI) design.

<br>**Project Status**
<br>ðŸš§ Under Development
<br>The backend of the project is currently complete. The frontend implementation, using React, is still in progress.

<br>**Project Overview**
<br>The project is designed to build a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with the following primary objectives:
<br>* Practice OOP principles in Python
<br>* Develop a robust backend game logic for Tic-Tac-Toe
<br>* Gain experience in designing and implementing a user interface (UI) using React (upcoming)

<br>**Technologies Used**
<br>* Backend: Python
<br>* Frontend: React (to be implemented)

<br>**Next Steps**
<br>* Complete the frontend using React to enable a fully interactive UI.
<br>* Integrate the backend with the frontend for a seamless user experience.
