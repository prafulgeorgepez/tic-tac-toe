# tic-tac-toe
This repository contains a Tic-Tac-Toe game project developed as a study exercise to explore key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), algorithmic thinking, and user interface (UI) design.

**Project Status**
ðŸš§ Under Development
The backend of the project is currently complete. The frontend implementation, using React, is still in progress.

**Project Overview**
The project is designed to build a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with the following primary objectives:

* Practice OOP principles in Python
* Develop a robust backend game logic for Tic-Tac-Toe
* Gain experience in designing and implementing a user interface (UI) using React (upcoming)
**Technologies Used**
* Backend: Python
* Frontend: React (to be implemented)
**Next Steps**
* Complete the frontend using React to enable a fully interactive UI.
* Integrate the backend with the frontend for a seamless user experience.
* Conduct testing and finalize the game.
